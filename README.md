## Overview

`PBI Tools` is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to automate Power BI version control processes directly from your code editor. This tool provides commands to extract data, compile Power BI files, and watch for changes â€” all from within VS Code.

## Features
- **Setup Pbi-tools**:Automatically downloads, extracts pbi-tools, and registers it to the environment variable.
- **Extract and Watch**: Automatically extracts Power BI reports and watches for changes with a simple command.
- **Extract File**: Quickly extract data from a specific `.pbix` Power BI file.
- **Compile Folder**: Compile a folder containing Power BI resources into a `.pbit` file format.
- **Hello World Command**: A sample command to demonstrate how the extension works.

## Commands

This extension registers several commands that can be accessed via the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) or bound to custom keybindings:

- `PBI Tools: Setup`(`pbi-tools.setup`): Automatically sets up pbi-tools by downloading and extracting the necessary files and registering the tool to your environment.
- `PBI Tools: Extract and Watch` (`pbi-tools.extractWatch`): Automatically extract Power BI data and watch for file changes.
- `PBI Tools: Extract` (`pbi-tools.extractFile`): Extract a specific `.pbix` file (default is `MOH.pbix`).
- `PBI Tools: Compile Folder to PBIT` (`pbi-tools.compileFolder`): Compile a folder into a `.pbit` file format.
- `PBI Tools: Hello World` (`pbi-tools.helloWorld`): Display a simple message to test the extension.
